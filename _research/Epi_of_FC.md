excerpt: "We use network regressions to quantify the spillover effects of financial constraints on investment behavior in production networks. The impact of financial constraints on a firm's investment spending transmits to supply-chain partners with interdependent investment opportunities. We estimate that this transmission through the supply chain induces a network multiplier that roughly doubles the forgone investment imposed by financial constraints. These effects propagate primarily upstream, and they strongly influence supply-chain network formation. We exploit a Network Regression Discontinuity Design to quantify the spillover effects of loan covenant violations for supply-chain partners' investments, which facilitates a causal interpretation. Overall, we show that ignoring spillovers may considerably understate the consequences of financial constraints on aggregate investment behavior."
