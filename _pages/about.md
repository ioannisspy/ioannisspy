## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Kogod School of Business. My research focuses on the implications of capital market access for firms and households. I love using data to evaluate questions that change or improve my priors and transforming scientific work into classroom practice. If you want to chat, feel free to contact me!
