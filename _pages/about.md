### Welcome!

<!-- ### Assistant Professor of Finance, Kogod School of Business, American University -->
I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Kogod School of Business. My research focuses on capital market access and how it affects firms and people. I love working with data that help me improve my priors, and bugging my students about the importance of learning finance. Feel free to contact me any time to chat!  <br />
