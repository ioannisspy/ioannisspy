excerpt: "I investigate whether restrictive loan covenants disrupt or improve firm operating performance. Using an instrumental variables approach to address the endogenous relationship between covenant strictness and firms efficiency, I find that stricter loan covenants lead to an increase in profitability and firm value even when firms do not violate a covenant. Stricter covenants improve performance only in firms with managerial agency conflicts: those without large shareholder ownership, facing softer competition in their product market, or with weaker shareholder rights. The evidence suggests that by designing stringent contracts ex ante, creditors create positive externalities in poorly governed firms through managerial incentives."
