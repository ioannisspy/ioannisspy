# Welcome!


I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Kogod School of Business. My research focuses on how access to capital markets affects firms and households. 
<!-- I love using data to evaluate questions that change or improve my priors and transforming scientific work into classroom practice.  -->
I love playing devil's advocate, and finding simple ways to explain complicated stuff.
